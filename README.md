# TAP Relation Types Experiments
This is the public repository for the experiments and results on the the relation types of taxonomy alignment cases. 


## Replay the experiments
To replay the experiments you can use the EulerX toolkit. There are two ways available to work with the tool. You can either install the Euler/X tool locally, or you can create a github codespace within the Euler/X repository. 
Please refer to the README of [euler2](https://github.com/rodenhausen/ASIST17/blob/master/euler2/README.md) for more information on how to run the use cases of the paper.
